## Introduction
Hubris RPG is an tabletop roleplaying game that prides itself on it's simplicity. Characters are not supposed to grow old. The progression system is built to create a very steep increase in damage but a very slow increase in survivability.

Hubris is playable with just basics but also contain some optional systems. Even with all optional systems active it still aims to be simpler than almost any contemporaries. The optional systems aim to give a rich and unique TTRPG experience to anyone, the basic system aims to be so simple even a drunk idiot can play. The goal of the rules is to provide freedom, not restrictions.

Hubris aims to be **atomic**. You should not need to know anything until it comes up, and will be informed then. A weapon or spell should not say "stun" and make you go searching for the conditions table. It should say "stun" (unable to move or take any actions for X turns) right there on the spell or weapon. 

As with any TTRPG, these rules are just guidelines. Modify and expand as you see fit.

## Setting
The Hubris RPG can be adapted to any setting, but it's created specifically with megadungeons in mind. **The rules present in the system support that setting**, but they should be easily adaptable. The system itself is very barren in terms of storytelling, so it falls to the setting to create stories.

The settings should, in the spirit of Hubris RPG, be simple. At least it should be presented that way to the players. Stories should rather be driven by player motivation and story should be emergent over the course of the campaign. The setting should be an evolving thing. Sarting out with a just a simple hook/pitch, then carved out in more intricate detail as the game goes on.

Player Characters should have little to no Backstory. Just a simple motivation that spurs them into adventure. Player Characters are expendable, and supposed to be expended. New player characters can recover the loot of old player characters that died earlier.

## Basics
- Player characters are human. They get no bonuses. They can not see in the dark. 
- They start at level 1. **Regardless**
- There is no alignment. Player characters are driven by both vice and virtue.  
- There are no classes. Character identity and playstyle is derived from stats.
- **ALL** Rolls are 1d20 + the relevant stat(s), unless otherwise specified.
- Hacksilver is the universal currency.
- Spells are not learned on level up, they have to be found in the world.
- There are 3 languages. Common, Underworld and Cryptic. 
	- Common is known to all PCs from the start.
	- Underworld is spoken by creatures dwelling very deep in the dungeons. 
	  (as a rule of thumb, if a creature has never seen daylight it only speaks underworld) 
	  PCs can gradually learn to speak underworld when they venture deep enough.
	  It's an almost entirely unwritten language. Reading in the dark is hard. Creatures that live in the deep and can read or write typically write and read common or Cryptic. 
	* Cryptic are runes and markings left by unknown creatures. 
	  It can never be learned, only deciphered in small portions at a time.

There is no "to hit" rolls. You only roll for damage. Attacks just hit presuming the target does not successfully roll for evasion. Damage is reduced directly with armor. 1 armor reduces damage by 1. It can also be variable like 1d4 armor.

HP is 1+d4, then increases by 1+d4 every level up.
You start with 1 in all stats, then you gain 2 stat points to invest as you wish at every level.

Miscellaneous rules that didn't really fit neatly in any if the stat pages.
##### Resting
Characters can take short and long rests.

It takes 1 session to reach level 2, 2 sessions to reach 3, 3 sessions to reach 4, and so on. Characters can be different level in the same party.
