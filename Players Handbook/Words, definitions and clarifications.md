**Distance** 
There is only three distances in Hubris. Touch, Melee and Ranged. 
Touch means you have to be so close you can reach it with your bare hands.
Melee signifies the range in which melee weapons like swords and axes are effective.
Ranged is anything greater, Thrown items, bows and most spells are ranged.
