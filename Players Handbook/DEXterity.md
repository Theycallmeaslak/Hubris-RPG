___
#### DEXterity 
- Determines turn order (after initative and surprise)
- Is used for skill checks related to difficult precise hand coordination 
	- Lockpicking, Needlework, Surgery, Pickpocketing
- is used for skill checks related to technically difficult movements
	- Acrobatics, Squeezing through narrow spaces, Dancing 
- Can be a requirement for certain weapons, but usually not. 
#### Critical hits
##### Critical Chance / Crit %
Critical hits are rolled by rolling one or more D20s, which causes a crit on a 20.
Every level of DEX increases the number of die cast by 1, up to three.
After that each level of DEX improves one die, Now that die crits on a 19.
After that each, the die are once again improved to crit on 18.
Crit chance from DEX caps out at 9, but can be further increased with items and magical effects.

It's easier to roll crits with 3 d20, one of a different color. If you have one dice of a higher level thats the one in a different color, and if you have two thats the two who share color.
##### Critical Damage / Crit DMG
Critical damage is added to your damage.
Critical damage is your base damage (weapon damage+str)
Multiplied by 0.5 for each level of DEX (ie, you need +2 dex to do double damage)
	To a maximum of 5x damage (unless the weapon specifics otherwise)
Plus an additional 1 damage for every point in DEX.

Damage from dice is multiplied by rolling additional dice. 
Except for the last +0.5, which is simply half of your last roll (rounded up).
The flat damage from strength or from weapon bonus is simply multiplied.
Unless stated otherwise by the weapon. 

Ie:, if you have 6 DEX and your regular damage is 4d6+5 then crit damage is 12d6+15+6
___
#### Evasion 
When you are attacked you roll 1 d20 for every point of DEX. 
You roll fewer die equal to the STR requirement of you armor.
	Denoted on the armor.
A 20 on any of the dice completely evades the attack.

**Spells cannot be evaded**, unless denoted on the spell itself.
___
#### Stealth.
Your stealth is equal to your DEX, reduced by the STR requirement of your current armor. Your stealth is how much closer your can get to a creature without being noticed, in foot. If your stealth is higher than their detection you can get all the way up to them without being noticed. 

All creatures are assumed to have infinite detection range where they can see, i.e., in front of them, unless it is dark or their vision is otherwise obstructed. Some creatures have additional detection abilities, like echolocation, or spiders feeling vibrations in their webs.

Player character detection is 15.
