Combat in Hubris is short and fast like combat in real life. If you want to be successful in battle, preparation and creativity is everything. Most monsters are too strong to face head on. 
___
##### Basic rules
- Characters have HP. If these drop to zero the character dies, or can roll to beg for mercy.
	- Think of health as more conceptual. Its a combination of your characters life force, their will to fight, their luck and so on.
- Characters have armor. This reduces damage directly by the value specified by the armor.
	- Armor can also be variable like "1d4 armor" this means you roll 1d4 every time you take damage.
- Characters have spells. These are limited usage consumables. 
- Characters have potions. These are single usage consumables. They can be thrown.
- Combat ends when all monsters or all player characters are unable to defend themselves.
- Characters drop unconscious at 1 hp, and die at 0.
##### Turn order
Turn order is determined first by Surprise, then by initiative (ie, the player who says "I attack" goes first), then lastly by Dexterity. There is no rolling. **Equal DEX leads to concurrent turns.** 
Monsters also have a DEX value, and they can also surprise the PCs. But generally players have the advantage. 
##### Monsters
Monsters have weird and unexpected abilities that break the rules of combat. They might attack multiple times a turn. They might counterattack you if you attack them on your turn. They might be resistant to one or multiple types of damage.

Monsters may also try to flee from combat if the tide of war is not in their favor, depending on their power and personality.

#### On your turn.
On your turn you have three resources. Movement, bonus action and action. 
- Movement is what you'd expect. Rolling, Climbing, jumping, etc also consumes movement.
- How far you can move is your speed, denoted on your character sheet.
- Difficult terrain like mud requires more movement to get through.
##### Main Action
Action is everything done with you main hand. 
- Attacking.
	- Melee weapons. Throwing weapons. Bows. Weaponless attacks like shoves and kicks.
	- Attacks can hit multiple opponents if they're packed together (at no extra penalty)
- Using spells.
- Interacting with the environment. 
	- Major interactions like tipping over a big statue or using a lever
- Any bonus action can be taken as an action (but not vice versa)
##### Bonus action
Bonus action is anything that is done by your off-hand.
- Attacking with your offhand weapon (only specific weapons can be put in the offhand)
	- AND, if you have a weapon in your offhand you can't use your bonus action for things that require an open hand. UNLIKE your action
- Attacking with the pommel or haft of a two-handed weapon. 
	- Damage and effects denoted on the weapon.
- Extracting an item from your inventory. 
- Drinking or throwing a potion. 
- interacting with the environment 
	- Minor interactions like opening a door or blowing out a candle
- Using a spell (Only spells specified as bonus-actions)
- Activate special items on your person (Unless the Item specifies costing a main action)
##### Full Turns
Some actions costs full turns, both actions and movement. This is denoted on the relevant item or spell, or is called at the discretion of the GM. For example, extracting a victim from a spider silk cocoon should be too difficult to do in just a main action.

___
##### Resolving an Attack
- The attacking character rolls for damage, and for critical hits. 
- Damage is specified on the weapon, plus strength. 
- All creatures hit roll for evasion if they have the ability to evade.
- If they succeed the evading roll they take no damage.
- If the creatures have any armor they reduce damage equal to the armor. 
##### Resolving a Spell
- The caster decides a target.
- The casting character rolls for spell misfire.
- Spell misfire occurs or not, and the spell is applied, all concurrently.
