#### Spell misfires
Whenever you cast a spell roll 1 d12. 
If it lands on 1 you get a misfire. You then roll on the spell missfire table.
The spell is still cast unless the missfire table denotes otherwise.

If you cast a spell with a spell level higher than your INT, add an additional d12 for every level the spell level exceeds your INT to your misfire roll. 
If you get multiple 1s you roll for multiple concurrent miscasts. 
If any of the misfire effect are inapplicable you reroll on the miscast table.
#### Inspect items
INTelligence is used to inspect mysterious items. 
Inspection rolls are hidden (rolled by the DM behind the screen).
- Some items have the mysterious property. This means they have still uknown effects
- A mysterious item can be inspected once per short or long rest. Unless a previous inspection has failed. 
- A successfull investigation reveals one new truth about the item. If all truths are revealed, the mysterious tag is stricken.
- If you fail an inspection, add an exclamation mark (!) to the mysterious tag. It's not possible to inspect further.
- Potions will never have their mysterious tag stricken unless they are used.
- As you reveal more about an item it's resale value increases. (Standard: 3d8)

##### Books. 
- if you have 0 INT, you're presumed to be illiterate.
- Books can be read once per short or long rest.
- You roll one D12 for every int (up to 5) keep the two highest against a DC denoted on the book. 
	- If it has a DC of 25 or higher it's impossible to read without special equipment.
- Successfully reading a book gives you a new bit of knowledge from the book.
- Books can be read over and over, until all knowledge in them is revealed.
