#### Critical hits
##### Critical Chance / Crit %
Critical hits are rolled by rolling one or more D20s, which causes a crit on a 20.
Every level of DEX increases the number of die cast by 1, up to three.

After that each, the die are once again improved to D6's that crit on 6.
##### Critical Damage / Crit DMG
Critical damage is added to your base damage
Critical damage is your base damage (weapon damage+str)
Multiplied by 0.5 for each level of DEX (ie, you need +2 dex to do double damage)
	To a maximum of 5x damage (unless the weapon specifices otherwise)
Plus an additional 1 Damage for everyone dex.
#### Evasion 
When you are attacked you roll 1 d20 for every pointof DEX. 
You roll fewer die equal to the STR requirement of you armor.
	Denoted on the armor.
A 20 on any of the dice completely evades the attack.

**Spells cannot be evaded**, unless denoted on the spell itself.
#### Stealth.
Your stealth is equal to your DEX, reduced by the STR requirement of your current armor. Your stealth is how much closer your can get to a creature without being noticed, in foot. If your stealth is higher than their detection you can get all the way up to them without being noticed. 

All creatures are assumed to have infinite detection range where they can see, i.e., in front of them, unless it is dark or their vision is otherwise obstructed. Some creatures have additional detection abilities, like echolocation, or spiders feeling vibrations in their webs.

Player character detection is 15.
