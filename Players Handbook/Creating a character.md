Creating a character is the first prerequisite of a player to play Hubris. 
It's designed to be a quick and easy process. Do not get too attached.
Characters can technically be level 0, but start at level 1.
___
### Characterisation
- Give your character a name
- Give your character a simple motivation to delve into dangerous dungeons
- Give your character a background, just an occupation will do.

Your character is a level 1 character. A real nobody. They first have to prove their mettle before their worthy of a significant Backstory. In other words, consider the first few sessions where you create that backstory. Playing as the character is the best way to develop their characterization further, and you'll not have the misfortune of developing a Backstory that is never used.
