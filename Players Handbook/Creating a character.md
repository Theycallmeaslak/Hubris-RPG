Creating a character is the first prerequisite of a player to play Hubris. 
It's designed to be a quick and easy process. Do not get too attached.
Characters can technically be level 0, but start at level 1.

### Characterization
- Give your character a name
- Give your character a simple motivation to delve into dangerous dungeons
- Give your character a background, just an occupation will do.

Your character is a level 1 character. A real nobody. They first have to prove their mettle before their worthy of a significant Backstory. In other words, consider the first few sessions where you create that backstory. Playing as the character is the best way to develop their characterization further, and you'll not have the misfortune of developing a Backstory that is never used.

### Gamification
- Roll for stat. Roll 1d4 and add one to the appropriate stat. 
	- 1-STR 2-DEX 3-INT 4-CHA
	- Add 1 health
- Congratulations, you now technically have a level 0 character, but characters start at level 1
___
- Level up. 
	- add 2 stats points as you want
	- roll 1d4+1 and add it to health
* Repeat this on subsequent level ups
____
### Itemization
* All characters start with simple clothes. 
* All characters start with a torch
* All characters start with an empty Journal

Equipment 
- If you have 1 DEX you start with a dagger. 
	- 1d4 damage, offhandable.
- If you have 1 STR you start with a shortsword
	- 1d6 damage.

- If you have neither DEX or STR you start with a quarterstaff
	- 1d4 damage.

- If you have 1 INT you start with a mysterious potion
	- One effect is revealed 
- if you have 1 CHA you start with 10 gold.

Lastly you character has some kind of memento. An item that is important to them.
- A locket with an image of a loved one
- A strange amulet they found in a dusty chest
- A wedding ring
- A funny rock they have kept since childhood.
- A silver spoon that has been in their family for generations

The item can be anything, the only requirements is that it's not a particularly useful item, and that it's important to the character.
