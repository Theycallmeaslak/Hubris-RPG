Where screams and blight, grow by the score.
It's born of sin, light no more.
Where hate and hunger stalks in the dark.
It brands your souls with a sickly mark.

Here sounds the song of death and pain
Here moonlight lays truth bare again.
When hope is over the mayhem begins.
Then madness reigns and knives make kings.

Evil maws water with endless lust.
A bloody altar, the death of trust.
Here champions fall, they die like ants.
The cruel halls fill with laughter and chants.

But here is power, here is gold.
Here is love, fame and glory sold.
Here are legends born, here heroes walk.
Enter now, donâ€™t stand and gawk.
