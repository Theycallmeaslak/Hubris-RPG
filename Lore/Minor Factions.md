## Minor Factions

##### He who wanders
A mysterious wanderer walks the halls and corridors. What does he want? Is he following you? Should you try to talk to him?
##### Extraplanar refugees
Peoples from other planes that have been sent to the dirt and have no way back. They band together in groups for their own safety. Suspicious and careful, but willing to trade and parley.
##### Merfolk
The merfolk live in the cavernous waters anywhere and everywhere in the roots of the Tower. They are a just but proud people, and if you insult them they will demand repayment in blood. They're often in conflict with human settlements as they often want to use those cavernous waters as sources of drinking water. 
##### The ferrymen
The ferrymen consider it their grim duty to aid travelers, that is, if you can pay their price. If you have a ferryman coin they're willing to take you anywhere in the tower. If you don't, you can argue and beg until you turn blue, it won't do you any good.
##### The Beast
The Beasts reigns in the mazes of blight. He crushes anyone and everyone who comes to close.
