### Stralthome

Stralthome is the underground fortress from which Queen Alinda the terrible and magnificent rules. It's hewn in the most oppressive basalt and granite dug from the earth and assembled by her loyal followers. A slight smell... stench... of vanilla is found in every nook and cranny of the castle. Queen Alinda marches through the ramparts and towers, up and down, snapping her fingers and having her every wish attended to by her loyal servants

### Mazza 

The ancient city of Mazza is found deep in the core of the obsidian tower. Empty and abandoned, the City now serves as no more than the territory of the beast.
