## Major Factions

##### Queen Alinda
Beautiful as the starry night sky, Queen Alinda rules from the seat of Stralthome and names herself Queen of the Tower, Queen of Obsidian. Her devoted champions carry her will up and down the tower. She sends  many of her champions to their deaths at the hands of The Beast, yet their loyalty remains unwavering. 
##### Nornes of the black glass
The nornes worship the tower and the dark obsidian from which the tower is build. They carry around any fragment of it they can get their hands on and protect it with their lives. They group together in covens at all levels of the Tower and carry out religious rites and sacrifices there. They are mostly pacifist, but will go to war and lay down their life if they believe it to be in service of the Tower. 
##### Salt
The salt covenant, colloquially known as just Salt is a company of mercenaries active in the tower, although in reality they're less mercenaries and more just an extortion racket. Towns and villages have been known to suspiciously catch fire not long after rejecting the protection of Salt. 
##### Lich Malifander
In the depths of the tower a mighty lich works the blackest of magics. A legion of minions patrol every corridor and room for miles and miles around Malifander. The legends say Malifander is the only being that knows the origins of the tower.
##### The marble chalice
Whereas the nornes of the black glass are the ancient religion of the tower, the marble chalice, or sometimes simply Chalice or Chalice cult is the new religion. The marble chalice believws that the Obsidian tower is inheritely sinful and "wrong", but that it can be redeemed and saved if only they eliminate a vaugely defined selection of "undesirables" and "sinners". The marble chalice was founded by **Isidor the great**, who made his legend by stopping a plauge that was ravaging the Tower around 300 years ago. While they are theologically opposed to the nornes, only the most extremists of zealots engage in open hostility, as both religions have more than enough enemies in common.
