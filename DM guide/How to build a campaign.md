The Labyrinth

The labyrinth is a sprawling complex that reaches out in every direction, but perhaps is far less impressive in it's vertical dimension than other megadungeons. The labyrinth should start at the periphery and getting towards the center to face the proverbial minotaur should be harder and harder. The labyrinth then is sectioned off into zones rather than floors, and as the characters advance in the dungeon travel between previous zones should be quite more trivial than it started out.

Metro 2033 is an excellent literary example of a labyrinth. The story starts off with Artyom needing to travel to polis station. Just a mere three station trek. Obviously it was never gonna be that simple. The story and the world keeps expanding as Artyom becomes wealthier, makes a name for himself in the metro, and gains allies along the way. New modes of traversal open up to him, like traveling across the two longest lines in the metro, The Hansa Ring and The Red Line, each occupied by the most powerful factions. Eventually he even learns to traverse the radioactive and mutant-infested surface.
