## Introduction
Hubris RPG aims to be simple to play, it therefore also aims to be equally simple to run. 
## Core Tenets:
##### Permadeath
Permadeath is vital for the function and feel of Hubris to remain intact. Characters are dead when they die. Perhaps incredible luck with potions might save someone who just dropped to zero hp, but keep in mind 3 minutes of oxygen starvation causes permanent brain damage. Necromancy might exist but creatures do not retain any of their intelligence when raised. 
This is vital for the flow of the game. Characters can be made in 10 minutes at the start of a session, and discarded willy nilly by the end. 
##### Persistent worlds
Characters don't last. As such, to give players a tangible sense and feeling of progression and reward, the changes that materialise in the world are the necessary replacement. The upper floors of the megadungeon should become more and more habitable as more and more heroes venture down and gradually solve problems and make it safer.
##### Loot-driven
The simple system of hack, slash, loot is the core gameplay of Hubris. Spells and potions are gained through loot. Items and weapons are gained through loot. Gold is gained through loot. Therefore all the core stats, (STR, DEX, INT, CHA) are only valuable in their relationship with loot. 
##### Fights are short and deadly
To keep the tenet of permadeath intact, and to keep the game moving and interesting, fights are short and brutal. All characters can deal out incredible amounts of damage and none of them have the HP to survive it.
##### Rulings over Rules
The RPG system is supposed to enable fun, roleplay and exploration. Having to open a rules book and start flipping through pages is the opposite of fun. 


### Monsters
Monster play by different rules than player characters. 
Monsters need only a two things explicitly defined
- Health 
- Damage
Other things are either assumed to be zero (like damage reduction) or equal to a default value. Here are a list of default values:

| value | value of that value | unit |
|---|---|---|
|Speed|30|ft|
|Size|medium|N/A|
|Attacks|1|number|
| Range (melee) |5|ft|
| Range (ranged)|30/60|ft|
| Ranged (throws) | 15|ft


### Loot
All loot drops should contain at least:
* Two different weapons
* A unique armor
* Gold
* Valuables. (Can be converted to gold at a vendor. Easier to carry than gold)
* One potion and One spell

It's advicable to make loot into cards. This gives them more physicality which encorages use, and lets you hand them out. You can also use this to randomize loot

Weapons, Armor and Spells should be simple, powerful and versatile. 
Players should both want to and be forced to use their items. 

Loot can (and should) have the "mysterious" property. This means that the item has one or more hidden magical effects that will not be discovered until it is activated (ie, bonus damage against spiders is only discovered when you attack spiders) or if it is revealed by a player character using their INT.

Potions should be completely mysterious, but described in detail. Such as the size and ornamentation. Is it a bottle, vial, jar or even a syringe? Is it easily throwable? Did the creator of this potion, or even of just the bottle, leave a marking to take credit? Does it hiss like acid or bubble like volcanic mud. Does it swirl even without agitation or does it refuse to swirl even with. Make it fantastical and descriptive so that the players are not gonna forget they have the potion.

Let color be completely random (roll for it after creating the potion) to avoid falling into pitfalls of creating red health potions and so on. Potions should be chaotic in nature, and have random and contradicting effects. 
INT can be used to reveal things about potions, but never everything (ie, even if everything is revealed just leave the mysterious property, no matter how many books you read you'll not know until you've tried it).
It's should also sometimes be possible to observe creatures ingesting the potion to learn more.

Potions should be more powerful than any other action you can take in combat, as they are the only resource that is single use. You can as you please let them be either actions or bonus actions, or you can say that using them as actions confers the effects instantly while using them as bonus actions confers the effect by the start of next turn.
