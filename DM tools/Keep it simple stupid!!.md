### 6 option encounter table
---
There is not really much benefit to creating huge encounter tables. These are nice as a creative exercise, but serve little value to the players. Create instead tables of 6 encounters (or less!). You can then spend much more time actually fleshing out these encounters and making them memorable and worthwhile. The players will only experience one random encounter regardless if you pulled from a list of 100 pr a list of 6, but the quality of the encounter will be much different from a list of 100 or of 6. But the encounters are of much higher quality

### One session at a time
---
There is limited benefit to fleshing out a whole world before you have actually thought about the encounters the players will actually meet and engage with. This is the lens your players will be experiencing the world through. Why put all your effort into creating a wonderful and perfect vision when most of it is going to be far out of the reach of your players? Creating some degree of lore, and having some abstract ideas about where the story is going could be good if it serves as an aid to writing the actual sessions more effectively, and perhaps running them more effectively when you have material to draw upon. But they should always play second fiddle. 

### Use your best ideas first
----
Use your best ideas first. These are the best ideas you could currently come up with. In the future you will have developed into a better writer and artist, so your future best ideas will obviously be even better. But the best way you can develop as a writer and artist is to put down your best work now. A seed only starts properly growing once it's planted

### Reskin common tropes
---
Every player are familiar with orcs and goblins. But the mysterious "Nightstalker", and the odd "Crystal toad" are things they have never seen before. Simply take stat blocks and abilities from old tired ideas and give them new names. Tweak their properties slightly if you must. Your players are not able to appreciate the effort that goes into creating a monster from the ground up.
