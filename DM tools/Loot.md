### Loot
___
All loot drops should contain at least:
* Two different weapons
* A unique armor
* Gold
* Valuables. (Can be converted to gold at a vendor. Easier to carry than gold)
* One potion and One spell

It's adviceable to make loot into cards. This gives them more physicality which encourages use, and lets you hand them out. You can also use this to randomize loot

Weapons, Armor and Spells should be simple, powerful and versatile. 
Players should both want to and be forced to use their items. 

### Mysterious loot
___ 

Loot can (and should) have the "mysterious" property. This means that the item has one or more hidden magical effects that will not be discovered until it is activated (ie, bonus damage against spiders is only discovered when you attack spiders) or if it is revealed by a player character using their INT.

### Potions
___
To encourage players to use rather than hoard potions, a few relatively simple tweaks go a long way. 

▪ Simply overload your players with potions. They have limited carrying capacity. If they ever have to leave loot behind because they have too many potions on them, they will regret not using them earlier

▪ Make potions with effect that have wide utility. A strength potion and a fire resistance potion are both useful, but a potion that transform you into a strong, fire resistant demon, is applicable in far more situations. Avoid overly convoluted effects. A potion that makes you deal more damage with swords or ice magic is far more likely to go unused than a potion that makes you flatly deal more damage. 

▪ Giving potions the mysterious quality keeps them more present in players minds. 

Potions should be described in detail. Such as the size and ornamentation. Is it a bottle, vial, jar or even a syringe? Is it easily throwable? Did the creator of this potion, or even of just the bottle, leave a marking to take credit? Does it hiss like acid or bubble like volcanic mud. Does it swirl even without agitation or does it refuse to swirl even with. Make it fantastical and descriptive so that the players are not gonna forget they have the potion. Make sure you specify that the potion is (or isn't?) *labeled* "Healing potion", not that it "is" a healing potion. It should of course still be a healing potion... most of the time. If its not that's an excellent opportunity to reward players for being diligent and inspecting their potions rather than just taking the label as fact. 

Let color be completely random (roll for it after creating the potion) to avoid falling into pitfalls of creating red health potions and so on. Potions should be chaotic in nature, and have random and contradicting effects. 
INT can be used to reveal things about potions, but never everything (ie, even if everything is revealed just leave the mysterious property, no matter how many books you read you'll not know until you've tried it).
It's should also sometimes be possible to observe creatures ingesting the potion to learn more.

Potions should be more powerful than any other action you can take in combat, as they are the only resource that is single use. You can as you please let them be either actions or bonus actions, or you can say that using them as actions confers the effects instantly while using them as bonus actions confers the effect by the start of next turn.
