### Create verticality
___
Verticality creates areas of the battlefield that are of higher and lower value to control. It allows characters to do something beneficial with their movement, moving into a higher value area, and therefore incentives the players to use all their resources in combat rather to just all clump up on the same enemy. This creates more choice and allows more player expression.

### Create a dynamic battlefield
---
Time can seem to "meander" in TTRPGs, having no stakes or consequence. Mitigate this by making things happen in combat. A good place to start is to have enemies that can throw buffs on themselves. A simple example is Duregar that can use enlarge. This incentives the players to win quickly, and builds higher tension. Whereas if the enemies simply attack the players there is some degree of building tension, but it goes at the cost of player resources, which encourages resting, further dragging out the pace of the game. 

### Simple efficiency tweaks
---
Weaker enemies like run of the mill goblins and slimes do not need hitpoints. They can simply die in one hit because they're probably going to anyways.  For other enemies, just give them integers of 10 in health. The players will not notice any difference, in fact there will only extremely rarely even be a difference, and it massively eases running and designing combat.

### Roll in the open
---
Rolling in the open creates a much greater sense of tension to every roll. When you roll in the open you let the players see the situation as it unfolds, and there is no opprtunity for fudging. Your players know with a newfound certainty that if they prevail those victories are fully genuine and not something you as a the DM made happen as that was most convenient to the story. 

### Mostly ignore movement
---
If there are no concrete obstacles, simply let players run up and hit the enemy. Getting out the ruler to measure if there truly is 5 more than 5 inches between the two characters is just as boring as sifting through rulebooks. If the distance is cearly going to be too far, simply point to a place and say "you can get to about here" do this entierly by feel. A tile this or that way isn't gonna make any difference when its still never gonna take more than one extra turn to reach the opponent anyways. 

### Deadly or trivial 
___
Combat should pretty much always be either a battle for survival or massive stomp in the players favor. Otherwise the encounter simply serves to wear out the players resources. That perhaps also has its place to be sure, but most DMs aren't all about delivering that dungeon delving survival gameplay, and combat is mostly part of the story. 

Damage should also be massive compared to HP. combat that lasts more than 5 turns should pretty much be entierly out of the question. Let combat be decided in the first few rounds. This creates a sense of "realness" nothing else can replicate. Real fights with sharp weapons are typically decided awfully quickly.
