## Core Tenets:
##### Permadeath
Permadeath is vital for the function and feel of Hubris to remain intact. Characters are dead when they die. Necromancy might exist but creatures do not retain any of their intelligence when raised. This is vital for the flow of the game. Characters can be made in 10 minutes at the start of a session, and discarded willy nilly by the end. Fights are short and deadly
See: [[Creating a character]]
##### Persistent worlds
Characters don't last. As such, to give players a tangible sense and feeling of progression and reward, the changes that materialise in the world are the necessary replacement. The upper floors of the megadungeon should become more and more habitable as more and more heroes venture down and gradually solve problems and make it safer.
##### Loot-driven
The simple system of hack, slash, loot is the core gameplay of Hubris. Spells and potions are gained through loot. Items and weapons are gained through loot. Gold is gained through loot. Therefore all the core stats, (STR, DEX, INT, CHA) are only valuable in their relationship with loot. 
##### Rulings over Rules
The RPG system is supposed to enable fun, roleplay and exploration. Having to open a rules book and start flipping through pages is the opposite of fun. The DM is empowered to make quick and dirty calls and desicions to enable the flow of the game.
##### Emergent gameplay and story
The rules and atomic nature of the system lends itself to be powerfully player driven. It's the loot and ingenuity of the players that creates the substance of the story. There should be some overarching plot in uncovering the depths of the megadungeon and facing off against the final opponents in it, but the story should shaped by the players.
