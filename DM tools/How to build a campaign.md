Hubris is a system designed for megadungeons. If you want to play anything else you will have to make adjustments and adaptation. 

#### The megadungeon
The megadungeon is the locale for all our heroes heroic exploits. A megadungeon is natrually increasing in danger as you progress through it.

#### Types

##### The classic

The classic megadungeon is usually literally a dungeon, going almost infinitely down with floors upon floors of increasing danger. Alternatively it can be a tower that goes up and up, or of course both. The main tropes are that the dungeon is split into multiple floors. 

Prey is my personal favourite flavour of this. Even if it seemingly takes place on a space station, make no mistake, it certainly is a megadungeon in it's own way. In fact it was even based on an explicit megadungeon in one of Arkane Studios earlier works, Arx Fatalis.  You access more and more dangerous areas as time goes on. You also gain the ability to backtrack far easier after a while as you can unlock the various sections of the space station and evade the typhon by traversing the space station on the outside. This of course wouldn't be viable lore-wise in an actual dungeon, but the concept of unlocking easier access to past areas can certainly be done easily. 
##### The Labyrinth

The labyrinth is a sprawling complex that reaches out in every direction, but perhaps is far less impressive in it's vertical dimension than other megadungeons. The labyrinth should start at the periphery and getting towards the center to face the proverbial minotaur should be harder and harder. The labyrinth then is sectioned off into zones rather than floors, and as the characters advance in the dungeon travel between previous zones should be quite more trivial than it started out.

Metro 2033 is an excellent literary example of a labyrinth. The story starts off with Artyom needing to travel to polis station. Just a mere three station trek. Obviously it was never gonna be that simple. The story and the world keeps expanding as Artyom becomes wealthier, makes a name for himself in the metro, and gains allies along the way. New modes of traversal open up to him, like traveling across the two longest lines in the metro, The Hansa Ring and The Red Line, each occupied by the most powerful factions. Eventually he even learns to traverse the radioactive and mutant-infested surface. 

##### The town

Even a town or city can be a megadungeon. To make it so, simply make the city be a city in some or several kinds of strife, turmoil or chaos. Religious extremism, plauge, revolutionary rebellion or war. Having the megadungeon under the open sky lets you play with time of day, weather and seasons. You can still section of zones with rivers, bridges and walls, and guards that won't let you through unless you have this or that permit, or environmental hazards that require specific equipment, like toxic gas or radiation you can't enter without a hazard suit.

Pathologic and Pathologic 2 are excellent examples of this. The city the game takes place in is infested with a deadly plauge. The world is "free" to explore, but the survival mechanics of the game makes travel much more restrictive. The gangs and militaries that hold power restrict your free movement, some sections of the time eventually become infested, and violent criminals roam the street and attack you on sight. Eventually you can aquire a firearm, better equipment, and special coins that ferrymen will take as payment to move you across the city faster. You make friends with the Military and the other factions and in turn they give you access to the areas you need to visit.
