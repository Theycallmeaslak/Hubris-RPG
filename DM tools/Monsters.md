### Monsters
___

Monsters are the backbone of Hubris RPG. They themselves are the challenges to overcome. Monsters are vicious and do not play by the rules. Engaging in combat prepared should be dangerous, engaging in combat unprepared should be deadly. 

Monsters are the creatures that inhabit this world. They have unique and powerful abilities, strange customs and behaviours, and are relentlessly territorial. Monsters should be described to the players, but do not refer to them by name, unless the players have prior knowledge of these monsters from a book or written source. Particularly rare and dangerous monsters should even have several names to underscore their mystique. Give the players a chance to name the monster if they have yet to hear a name for it.

Monsters should telegraph how dangerous they are, so the player characters can make meaningful choices in whether they choose to engage them or not. Monsters should sometimes be possible to deal with without resorting to violence, but this should *not* be an easy way out. 

### Themes are king 
___
A monster should present the players with certain themes. A monster should have a motivation and preform actions in line with some characterisation. It doesn't need to be feasible to reason with every monster, but having all monsters be ravenous beasts intent on nothing but destruction is simply weak storytelling and leaves the players very little wiggle room to deal with monsters in interesting and creative ways.
