*The Mirror of Guilt*

**Room 1/Entrance (Guilt/Truth)**
You enter this dungeon by interacting with an enchanted mirror. From the outside the mirror refeclts only deep black vois, but as you reach ot towards it, your hand simply slips into the mirror.

As you step through you appear from a painting hanging in a corridor. There's a long red carpet along the floor. In one direction is a big castle gate that doesn't budge of if you try to open it. 

**Room 2/the reception (Knight of Beakers)**
The other direction leads you to a reception. There's a front desk with shelves of books and bottles behind it, and a huge tome lies open, with a magnifying suspended over it by an articulated mechanical arm. The room is lit by a mighty candelabra in the ceiling. There is a seating group on the corner.

An old man named Elijah Ravens in formal attire approaches you, seemingly the custodian of this place. He greets you and welcomes you to "the interior" whatever that means. There is a spiraling staircase leading to a gallery in the ceiling. There's an archway to another corridor next to the front desk. The old man instructs you to go up the spiral staircase and talk to "the Madame".

**Room 3/the gallery**(Queen of beakers)
At the top of the spiral staircase you enter into a gallery. There is a large desk with a gaunt woman behind it named Agayla Illitch. She wears a long white hoodless coat in thick linen, and thick black rubber gloves. A pair of goggles is affixed to her forehead. She fixes you with a determined and authortiative glare.

The gallery is messy. Alchemical equipment is thrown around with seemingly no order. Papers full of text are everywhere. Candles reduced stubs dot floors and crates anywhere. Cobwebs have gathered in the ceilings. There's a spill of some magical elixir on the floor.

Agayla Illitch intructs you to report to the Laboritory

**Room 4/The Laboritory (science)**

As you enter the room two alchemists greet you. The laboratory is lavish. A fireplace with bellows take center stage on the left wall. Various steam pipes and copper wires flow everywhere from the fireplace delivering heat to various alchemical brews. A particularly large pipe leads to the center of the rool where it heats a big cauldron. The cauldron bubbles with green glowing liquid. The liquid fumes are pulled away by grates in the ceiling. 

On the right wall are three might storage shelves. One full with books, papers and folders, arranged in stacks rather than how they should be. The other is full bottles. Empty and full, of all colors, shapes and sizes. The last is it full pf various alien specimens preserved in vinegar. 

On the opposite wall is a reinforced door
