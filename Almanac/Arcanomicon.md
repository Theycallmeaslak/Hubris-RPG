**BEWARE** Magic is monstrously dangerous. Magic requires speaking the incarnation, and doing the magical gestures. You can cast without one of these components, but the chance of catastrophe is much greater! (Double the amount of misfire dice). 

Spells are physical items you have to carry in your inventory. They have limited usage, Equal to your INT or the Max defined by the spell, whichever is lesser. 

You can cast any spell you aquire, but if your INT is lower than the Spell level you roll additional spell misfire die equal to the difference. The Spell can also only be used onc in this case.
