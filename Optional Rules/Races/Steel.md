+2 armor, +2 CHA, Weakness to water and cold. You can't wear armor.

You were just a helpless peasant like anyone else, until one day your soul was extracted by a cruel magic user and inserted into a metal construction. Why? 

|roll|Reason|
|---|---|
|1| The evil wizard needed a servant to aid in his research|
|2| A sorcerer created you to sell as a curio to the highest bidder|
|3| You're simply a botched experiment, a failure in every sense|
|4| A death knight did this a punishment for having fought him|
|5| A loved one tried to save you from a death|
|6| You did this to yourself.| 

whatever the reason, most people feel sorry for you

**Magical animation**
You need neither food nor drink nor oxygen to live, but you need magical energy. magical energy can be extracted by killing living creatures, or destroying magical items. If you go 2 days without you can no longer recover health by any means. If you go 4 days without you become completely immobile, and in 1d4 days you die. 

**Restoring Health**
You cannot restore health by resting. You restore health by repairing yourself by buying metals from vendors. 1 gold is enough metals to heal 1 hp. You can restore health by healing potions, but only at half potency. 

**Level Up**
Your soul and body are separate. You level them individually. 
Your soul is levelled just like anyone else. 
Your body requires metals of gold value equal to the sum of your STR and DEX, squared

A soul level gives 1 stat point that can only be put in INT or CHA
A body level gives 1 stat point that can only be put in STR or DEX
It also gives you 1+1d4 health, and 1 armor.
