+2 int 
#### Introduction
You did something you shouldn't have. You asked too many questions, and got too many answers. The winds of magic have permanently and irreversibly altered your body. How exactly? Roll a d8 twice, reroll if you get the same outcome. If you misfire a spell you get a new alteration. 

If you get 7 alterations your blood turns to superheated plasma and you explode.

| Roll  | Feature  | Effect  |
|---|---|---|
|1|A second face|A second face has grown somewhere on your torso. It hates you. It perpetually strikes a grotesque grimace, as if a second face wasn't horrible enough to begin with. Sometimes it has something to say, but usually it's just muttering hatefully to itself.|
|2|Altered skin|Your skin has turned to an odd leathery texture. It's thick, ugly, and doesn't heal properly. You smell like an old abuser couch. +1 armor -1 CHA.|
|3|Third arm|A third arm has sprouted from your back. It can hold items like lanterns and torches, but it's awkward placement makes it of little use otherwise. You literally can't see what you're doing.|
|4|Living eye|A rare parasite has taken refuge in your right eye. It now lives there and nourishes itself on your lifeblood. Attacks from your right can't be evaded. The parasite is attuned to magic and starts wiggling when there is magic in the air, causing pain and dizziness.|
|5|Ooze symbiote|An Ooze lives on you and covers your skin head to toe. Its empowers you with it's abilities. 1d4:|
|6|Wooden tendrils|Tendrils protrude from all your extremities, you've tried to shave them off, but they always grow back within the fortnight. You can consume liquids with your tendrils, and they give you advantage on rolls that involve grabbing things.|
|7|Titanium teeth|Unsightly, but effective. 3d6 bite attack. You can easily and quickly gnaw through sticks or bone. You can flash your teeth to gain advantage to intimidation rolls.|
|8|Big head|You have an obscenely large head. The size of a medicine ball. Helmets do not fit you.|
