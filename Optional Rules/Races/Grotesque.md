+2 STR, +1 Armor, +1 CHA
You do not regain HP from short rest

A hulking creature with wing and fangs. An imposing creature that crushes and destroys. 

##### Stony rest
When you rest you turn into stone. In this state you're completely defenceless and anyone can smash you to bits with a hammer if they find you. Your only protection is that you look just like a statue and no one would have any reason to attack you if they didn't know your true nature. You spring back to life in exactly seven hours.

When you're on the surface the power of the sun forces you to rest during daytime (regardless if you take shelter or not). Underground you can also be forced into this stony rest by magical sunlight. 

Stony rest allows you to recover injuries that would be permanent for anyone else. Scars always clear up, even burns or acid. Regrowing a finger takes 1d4 cycles, a hand 2d6, an arm 3d6 cycles and a whole leg 4d8. 

**Wings**
You have gargantuan wings. Regrettably, being part stone makes you too heavy to utilize them for full flight, but you can glide fairly decently, and you jump twice as high.
