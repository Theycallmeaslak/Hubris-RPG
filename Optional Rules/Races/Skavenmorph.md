You stuck your nose somewhere you shouldn't have, and it turned you into a man sized rat. You can still transform back into a mostly human appearance, but it's a huge strain, and who's to say for how much longer before the transformation is fully irreversible. Roll 1 d4. Add 1. When you reach that level you can no longer turn back to your human form.
##### Rat form: 
+1 DEX, +1 STR, -2 CHA, mercy rolls always fail.

In your rat form your stronger, fiercer and scarier. Far to scary to be invited into the wrath of hospitality. You'll be lucky to get inside the town walls, and trade? Forget it. Maybe you can be tolerated if your fame grows great enough. Just cross your grubby little rat fingers that your fame will grow before it's too late.

You run twice as fast in rat form.
##### Human form:
-1 CHA. You still smell like a rat.

You appear human, except with a slightly longer, narrower face, and yellow, orange or red irises, and your hands are still rat hands. Otherwise you appear normal, but your behaviour is not fully that of a human. 

**Lead belly**
You can eat raw, rotten and poisoned food without consequence. 

**Metabolism**
You need to eat twice as much as anyone else to survive.
