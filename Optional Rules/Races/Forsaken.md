Weakness to silver

You died? You think. You're not really entirely sure. You can't really seem to remember how it happened. You just remember a stabbing pain. When you came too, lights were all painfully too bright and everything seemed like a haze. But you feel invigorated and strong. You have a relentless will embedded in you. And overwhelming drive to do.... something. What was it?

**Eternal Motivation**
You have been reanimated for an express purpose. If that purpose was your own or of someone else's design you do not know. In truth it doesn't matter. 
You gain advantage on rolls related to your eternal motivation.

**Unnatural animation**
You're not traditionally "alive", your cells behave and weird unconventional ways. You still need food and water to sustain yourself, But you're immune to toxins and disease. You can also survive for 12 minutes without oxygen. 

**Lead belly**
You can eat raw, rotten and poisoned food without consequence.

**Undeath**
When a forsaken die they're body may or may not reanimate in 1d4+1 days, but they're mind is shattered from the experience. They're now feral undead, non-player characters.
