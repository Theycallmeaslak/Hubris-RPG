## Abilities 

**Bard**
You can play any 3 instruments of choice. You can use vicious mockery. It deals 1d4 psychic damage. Increases to 2d4 at level 4 and to 3d4 at level 10.  You gain advantage on persuasion and deception rolls. If you speak underworld you can sing in underworld.

**Borrowed time**
When you drop to zero health the adrenaline coursing through your veins allows you to keep fighting for turns equal to STR or until combat ends. You still take damage in this time. If you're able to heal back to above 0 health during this time you survive but are left unconscious and defenceless for 1d6 days and delirious for another 1d6 days. 

**Eldritch Brand**
You're marked with a dark brand of some ancient deity. The mark gives you 4 strange supernatrual powers you can use one of per day. 
- The Brand sears and burns. It glows forcefully and keeps darkness at bay for the next hour.
- The Brand hums and sings. It projects a noise that distract nearby creatures.
- The Brand pulsates and vibrates. It warps you to a location you can see.
- The Brand writhes and froths. It covers the room in toxic smoke. You better get out quickly

**Hidden blade** 
You have hidden spring loaded blade mounted to your left wrist. (you have to use a dagger already in your inventory). When an opponents attacks you in melee range, you can immediately counterattack. However, the spring loaded blade chops off your middle finger if you still have it. (1d4 dmg)

**Hyneman** 
During a short rest you can build bombs that you can throw during combat. Building a bomb requires gunpowder, metal and string that can be bought at any general vendor for 6 gold. The DM rolls behind the screen to determine the power of the bomb, which is d20+INT. 

**Monster Hunter**
If you successfully identify the markings left by a monster you also learn of its one big weakness, and how to lure it. *Although luring it might result in an encounter with an awfully horny monster depending on the lure used*

**Oozemaster**
Every short rest you can create a jar of animated sludge. Break it and summon an ooze to fight for you. (3d4 hp, 2d4+2 acid damage). 

**Potion Maker**
Every short rest you can make a magical concoction... you have no clue what it does.
Requires an empty bottle. 

**Roaring in Tongue**
During combat you can roar and shout in some terrible alien language that terrify opponents. They are quicker to retreat or surrender, or perhaps won't even dare put up a fight at all. If creatures escape you'll soon enough get a reputation.

**Sacrificial rats**
You carry 3 rats in your belt. If you misfire a spell the misfire redirect to a rat. If the rats die they are dead and not easily be replenished as these rats are *special* rats. 

**Spellburn**
You can take 1d12 damage to increase the damage of a spell by 1 dice step, ie. D4s become D6s, D8s become D12s and so on.

**Whispers from the void**
You have a whispering voice inside your head. Sometimes gives you weird revelations and prophesies. Sometimes it commands you to do things, roll STR to resist. You see odd things that other people don't see. 

**Witch Doctor**
Whenever you or anyone in your party uses a non-potion healing item during a rest you double it's effect.
