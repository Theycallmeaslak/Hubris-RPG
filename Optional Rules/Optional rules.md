## Optional rules
Optional rules is for those who want a richer, deeper, crunchier experience. 
#### **Beware!!**
These rules, while cool in their own right, undermine the greatest asset of Hubris, its simplicity. One shots are best enjoyed without these optional rules, and if you are to use them, introduce them gradually.
##### Character funnel
Rather than starting at level 1, players can start with 3-4 level 0 characters, most of who will die in the first session. The survivors reach level 1. This creates 
##### Death Sigils
When a character dies 3 'sigils' are created. 
One is inherited by the next character of that player
One is left on the body to find
One is given when you succeed where that characer failed.
- such as killing the monster who killed them, or rescuing someone they failed to rescue and so on.
Acquiring a sigil gives you a stat point. 
If a character dies with sigils dies he drops one extra on his body for every 2 he had, and the next character inherits one extra for every 4 he had.

Finding a character who was granted mercy but retired as a player character (see mercy rules in CHArisma) gives you 2 sigils.
##### Exhaustion
When a character exerts themselves mightily they may take 1 level of exhaustion, up to a maximum of three. All levels of exhaustion includes the penalties from the previous levels. Exhaustion is caused by resting or can be cauted by spell, potion and spell misfire effects.

Exhaustion is removed by resting.
A long rest removes 2 levels and a short rest removes 1.
